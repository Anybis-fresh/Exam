Small webpage for my programming examination.
-In index.html I changed the title on my own student ID, added 3 inputs (for name, surname and age) and the button that on click call the Submit() function.
-In script.js file I made a simple Submit function that stores name, surname and age which were inputed in html, check whether they are or not and if age is 18 or above. Then if it is true function creates a new element <li> put there all the necessary information we stored and add it as the new element to the end of html. In case if any fild is empty or age is below
18 user gets a notification about it.
-In style.css I placed inputs and button at the center, changed the background of the whole body, added transition for button when user hover it and changed font sizes.
